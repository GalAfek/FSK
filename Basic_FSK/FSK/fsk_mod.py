    Perform Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulation on a given bit sequence.
    
    Parameters:
        bit_sequence: An NDArray of bits (0s and 1s) representing your digital data.
        freq0: The carrier frequency (in Hz) to represent a binary 0.
        freq1: The carrier frequency (in Hz) to represent a binary 1.

        baud_rate: The symbol rate in symbols per second.
